    Retrieves relevant context from the ChromaDB vector store based on a query.

    Args:
        query: The user's query.
        db_path: The path to the ChromaDB directory.
        collection_name: The name of the collection to query.
        model_name: The name of the Sentence Transformers model to use.
        n_results: The number of documents to retrieve.
        threshold: The maximum distance score for a document to be considered relevant.
                   ChromaDB uses distance metrics (like L2 squared), so a lower score is better.
                   A value of 0.0 means the threshold is disabled.

    Returns:
        A list of relevant document texts.
